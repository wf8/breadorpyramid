					<h4>Hello</h4>
					<p>I am a doctoral student in the <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/Baldwin-Lab.html">Baldwin Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. 
					My research interests revolve around empirical and theoretical aspects of 
					plant evolution, computational phylogenetics, and biodiversity informatics.</p> 
					<h4>Plant systematics and evolution</h4>
					<p>
					Currently, I'm using phylogenomic approaches to study reticulate evolution in <em>Chylismia</em> (Onagraceae).
					Previously, I worked on the phylogeny and divergence times of the North American <em>Rhodiola</em> 
					(Crassulaceae) using both nuclear and chloroplast DNA. 
					With other members of the Baldwin Lab, I'm also working on the phylogeny of <em>Hesperolinon</em> (Linaceae).
					</p>
					<h4>Computational phylogenetics</h4>
					<p>
                    I've developed software to data mine GenBank and construct supermatrices for large-scale phylogenetic analyses.
                    I'm also interested in developing Bayesian methods that reconcile incongruent gene trees by 
                    modeling hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting.
                    With these methods I hope to infer phylogenetic networks that explicitly represent the history of reticulate evolutionary events.
					</p>
					<h4>Biodiversity informatics</h4>
					<p>Working with non-profit and volunteer conservation groups, I have developed open source web-based tools to help manage and assess conservation projects.
					I'm interested in building tools that visualize biodiversity data and help make conservation management 
					more collaborative and transparent. Can we build useful tools for conservationists that incorporate metrics of 
					phylogenetic diversity?</p>
