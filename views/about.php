					<h4>Hello</h4>
					<p>I am a doctoral student in the <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/Baldwin-Lab.html">Baldwin Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. 
					My research interests revolve around empirical and theoretical aspects of 
					plant evolution, computational phylogenetics, and biodiversity informatics.</p> 
					<h4>Plant systematics and evolution</h4>
					<p>I've been researching the phylogeny and divergence times of the North American <em>Rhodiola</em> 
					(Crassulaceae) using both nuclear and chloroplast DNA. I am particularly interested in using
					phylogenomic approaches to resolve the evolutionary history of hybridization within plant groups.</p>
					<h4>Computational phylogenetics</h4>
					<p>How do we model the evolution of traits responsible for diversification 
					on molecular phylogenies? How can we infer phylogenetic networks to better understand reticulate evolution?
					I'm very interested in the theoretical and computational challenges involved in statistical
					phylogenetic inference.</p>
					<h4>Biodiversity informatics</h4>
					<p>Working with non-profit and volunteer conservation groups, I have developed open source web-based tools to help manage and assess conservation projects.
					I'm interested in building tools that visualize biodiversity data and help make conservation management 
					more collaborative and transparent. Can we build useful tools for conservationists that incorporate metrics of 
					phylogenetic diversity?</p>
