        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>The evolution of life has long been understood to be a branching process through time, with all extant species
        representing twigs on the tree of life. In the past 20 years, evolutionary biology has made enormous progress
        by mathematically modeling this branching process using the framework of phylogenetic theory. Currently,
        phylogenetic theory faces two major challenges that my research tackles: (1) estimating the effect of trait evolution
        on macroevolutionary diversification rates; and (2) inferring the reticulate evolutionary history of lineages that
        are simultaneously undergoing incomplete lineage sorting and processes such as hybridization or introgression.
