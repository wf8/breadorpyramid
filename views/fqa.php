						<h3>Universal FQA Calculator</h3>
						<p>Floristic Quality Assessments (FQAs) are metrics of ecological quality developed by Swink and Wilhelm in 1994.
						FQAs are calculated using coefficients of conservatism assigned to individual plant species based
						on their endemism to a certain habitat and tolerance to disturbance.</p>
						<p>
						Widely used by state and federal agencies as well as conservation non-profits 
						to monitor and assess natural areas, FQA databases have been developed for much of the United States. 
						However, all previous FQA computer programs only calculated FQA for a single region or habitat,
						and for many regions FQA must be calculated by hand.
						This web-based FQA calculator enables the user to choose from any existing FQA database, and as new FQA 
						databases are developed they can be uploaded into the site. Users can also compare coefficients across databases. 
						The site has a responsive user interface that can be used in the field on mobile devices.
						This project was developed with support from 
						<a href="http://www.openlands.org/">Openlands</a>.
