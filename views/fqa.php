						<h4>Universal FQA Calculator</h4>
						<p>The Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is a metric of ecological quality developed by Swink and Wilhelm in 1994.
						FQA is calculated using 'coefficients of conservatism' assigned to individual plant species based
						on their endemism to a certain habitat and tolerance to disturbance.</p>
						<p>
						Widely used by state and federal agencies as well as conservation non-profits 
						to monitor and assess natural areas, FQA databases have been developed for much of the United States. 
						However, all current FQA computer programs only calculate FQA for a single region or habitat,
						and for many regions FQA must be calculated by hand.
						This web-based FQA calculator will enable the user to choose from any existing FQA database, and as new FQA 
						databases are developed they can be uploaded into the site. This project is being developed with support from 
						<a href="http://www.openlands.org/">Openlands</a>.
